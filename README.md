About
-----

Filterss allows you to filter your RSS according to words that are (or are not) part of the title and of the link address of each item listed in any given RSS.

Installation
------------

* If you want, get your [Python](http://www.python.org) running under a [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv).
* Install whatever is needed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Then `./run.py` to start your server (you might have to give the right permissions to this script by typing `chmod a+x run.py`).
